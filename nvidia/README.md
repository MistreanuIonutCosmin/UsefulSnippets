1. What is CUDA?
   CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that makes using a GPU for general purpose computing simple.
   The CUDA platform is a software layer that gives direct access to the GPU's virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements, for the execution of compute kernels
   
2. What is CUDNN?
   The NVIDIA CUDAÂ® Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks. cuDNN provides highly tuned implementations for standard routines such as forward and backward convolution, pooling, normalization, and activation layers.
   Built on CUDA
    
3. What is CUDA Toolkit? (installs Driver and CUDA)
   The toolkit includes GPU-accelerated libraries, debugging and optimization tools, a C/C++ compiler and a runtime library

## Nvidia-Docker

! Only the driver must be installed on the host. The CUDA version from the container must be compatible with the host driver.

sudo apt-get install nvidia-container-toolkit
